auto_transition.py
====================

Define the transition between different waveguide type.

In SITRI pdk, an taper will be added between two ``WG.Channel.C`` waveguides with different width.

Users are allowed to define the taper and set ``DEFAULT`` to their own specific transition policy. Please see ``gpdk > components > transition`` for more examples.
